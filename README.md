# KTX Train Schedule

Very pleased with the UI on this project.

A train schedule application using Firebase to host arrival and destination data.  Moment.js manipulates the time information. This app provides up-to-date information about various trains: arrival times, how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station and frequency.  Trains may be deleted from the schedule as well.<br>
